## Workshop - Using LLMs in Humanities Research via API held on August 7th 2025

In this workshop, participants will learn how to access large language models via API and utilize them for bulk data analysis using Python. Through practical examples, we will explore prompt engineering techniques for tasks such as concept mining and named entity recognition in textual data. Additionally, we will examine challenges associated with historical digitized texts, including optical character recognition (OCR) errors, which may affect compatibility with language models. Participants will gain insights into how these models can be leveraged for error correction and translation, enhancing the usability of imperfect textual data.

The workshop is designed for researchers, data analysts, and professionals in text analysis, digital humanities, and computational linguistics. Only a basic familiarity with Python is required, which can be gained by attending introductory workshops at the summer school or reviewing the provided preparatory materials.

## About BSSDH

Welcome to the annual [Baltic Summer School of Digital Humanities (BSSDH 2025)](https://www.digitalhumanities.lv/bssdh/2025/about/)!

The 7th Baltic Summer School for Digital Humanities will be held in Riga at the University of Latvia's House of Science from August 4‚Äì8. This year‚Äôs Summer School will focus on topics relevant to history researchers, students, and anyone interested in exploring history and humanities through digital methods. Lectures and workshops will cover subjects such as automated digitization of handwritten texts, network visualization, historical networks, spatial analysis and mapping (GIS), as well as a practical overview of the emerging AI technologies and their use in humanities research, by using chat prompting versions and also accessing LLM (large language models) with API. You can see the confirmed keynote lectures and workshops here, the full programme will be finalized during March.
