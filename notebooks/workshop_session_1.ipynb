    "# Using LLMs in Humanities Research via API\n",
    "\n",
    "## Welcome to the Workshop on Using LLMs in Humanities Research via API!\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome into deeper world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications in humanities research! In an era where artificial intelligence is transforming every field of study, the humanities are experiencing a revolutionary shift in how we approach text analysis, interpretation, and research methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Workshop Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "The digital transformation of humanities research has opened unprecedented opportunities for scholars to analyze vast corpora of text, uncover hidden patterns, and gain new insights into human culture and expression. Large Language Models represent the cutting edge of this transformation, offering powerful tools for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automated text analysis** at scale previously impossible for human researchers\n",
    "- **Cross-lingual research** capabilities that break down language barriers\n",
    "- **Pattern recognition** in literary and historical texts\n",
    "- **Assistance with translation and transcription** of historical documents\n",
    "- **Enhanced accessibility** to digitized cultural heritage materials\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workshop Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this three-session workshop, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand the fundamentals** of Large Language Models and their capabilities for humanities research\n",
    "2. **Master API interactions** to programmatically access and utilize various LLM services\n",
    "3. **Learn practical applications** including concept mining, named entity recognition, and text analysis\n",
    "4. **Develop skills** in prompt engineering for humanities-specific tasks\n",
    "5. **Address real challenges** such as working with OCR errors in historical texts\n",
    "6. **Gain hands-on experience** with tools for error correction and translation\n",
    "7. **Build confidence** in integrating AI technologies into your research workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Makes This Approach Special\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than relying on simple chat interfaces, you'll learn to harness the full power of LLMs through API access, enabling:\n",
    "- **Batch processing** of large document collections\n",
    "- **Customizable workflows** tailored to your specific research needs\n",
    "- **Reproducible research** methods with documented processes\n",
    "- **Integration** with existing digital humanities tools and methodologies\n",
    "\n",
    "## Session 1 11.30-13.00 - Introduction to LLMs and APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "In our first session, we will explore the basics of Large Language Models (LLMs) and how to interact with them using APIs. We will cover the following topics:\n",
    "- **Setting Up Your Environment**: Instructions on how to set up your programming environment to interact with LLM APIs.\n",
    "- **What are LLMs?**: An introduction to Large Language Models, their capabilities, and how they can be applied in humanities research.\n",
    "- **Understanding APIs**: A brief overview of what APIs are, how they work, and why they are essential for accessing LLMs.\n",
    "- **Understanding JSON**: An introduction to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), the data format commonly used for API responses, and how to work with it in Python.\n",
    "- **OpenRouter API**: Introduction to the OpenRouter API, which provides access to various LLMs.\n"
