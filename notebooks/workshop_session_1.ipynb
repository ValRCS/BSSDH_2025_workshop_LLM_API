        "* 🌐 **HTTP Request**: You send this JSON to the LLM using an **HTTP request**, which is the same basic method your browser uses to visit websites—but in this case, it's your script or notebook making the request.\n",

The mention of the protagonist, Mārtiņš, looking at the distant horizon where the sun is setting behind the forest wall evokes a sense of longing and nostalgia for his homeland (\"dzimteni\"). The juxtaposition of the sadness for the homeland left behind and the hope for a new life in a foreign land reflects the complex emotions of exile and the search for belonging. The questions posed about whether he will return home and whether his children will speak Latvian also highlight the themes of identity and cultural preservation in the face of displacement.\n",

The mention of the protagonist's concern about his children speaking Latvian suggests a social context of cultural assimilation and the challenges faced by diaspora communities in maintaining their language and traditions in a foreign environment.\n",

        "## Securely loading API keys in your environment\n",
        "\n",
        "When working with APIs, especially those that require authentication, it's essential to handle API keys securely. Exposing your API keys can lead to unauthorized access and potential misuse of your account. Here are some best practices for securely loading API keys in your environment:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Use Environment Variables\n",
        "Store your API keys in system environment variables instead of hardcoding them in your scripts. This keeps sensitive information out of your codebase and version control.\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import os\n",
        "# Load API key from environment variable\n",
        "api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENROUTER_API_KEY\")\n",
        "if not api_key:\n",
        "    raise ValueError(\"API key not found in environment variables\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Above would require that you set up the environment variable `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in your operating system or development environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since most of us in this workshop are using Google Colab we do not have this particular system variable set up. Instead, we will use a `.env` file to store our API key and load it using the `python-dotenv` library.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Use a `.env` File\n",
        "For local development, you can use a `.env` file to store your environment variables. This file should not be committed to version control (add it to your `.gitignore` file).\n",
        "```plaintext\n",
        "# .env file\n",
        "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Use a Library to Load Environment Variables\n",
        "Use a library like `python-dotenv` to load environment variables from a `.env` file.\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from dotenv import load_dotenv\n",
        "# Load environment variables from .env file\n",
        "load_dotenv()\n",
        "# Now you can access your API key\n",
        "api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENROUTER_API_KEY\")\n",
        "if not api_key:\n",
        "    raise ValueError(\"API key not found in environment variables\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Keep Your `.env` File Secure\n",
        "Ensure that your `.env` file is not accessible to unauthorized users. Set appropriate file permissions and avoid sharing it publicly.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Rotate Your API Keys Regularly\n",
        "Regularly rotate your API keys to minimize the risk of unauthorized access. Most API providers allow you to generate new keys and revoke old ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Set limits on API Key Usage\n",
        "If your API provider allows it, set usage limits on your API keys to prevent abuse. This can include rate limiting or restricting access to specific IP addresses or applications. In our workshop each individual API KEY has a limit of 1 Euro, which is sufficient for the workshop tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. Alternative use getpass\n",
        "If you prefer not to use a `.env` file, you can use the `getpass` module to securely prompt for your API key at runtime. This way, the key is not stored in your code or a file.\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import getpass\n",
        "# Prompt for API key securely without showing it on the screen\n",
        "api_key = getpass.getpass(\"Enter your OpenRouter API key: \")\n",
        "if not api_key:\n",
        "    raise ValueError(\"API key cannot be empty\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Code that utilizes all 3 approaches to load the API key\n",
        "\n",
        "Below cell has code that first will try to load the API key from the environment variable, then from a `.env` file, and finally prompt the user to enter it if neither of the first two methods succeed.\n",
