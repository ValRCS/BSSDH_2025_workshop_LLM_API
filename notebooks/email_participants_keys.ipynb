    "# Emailing Participants with API\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is used to email participants with their API keys. This is not to be used by participants themselves, but rather by the workshop organizers to send out keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you can take a look at the code to see how bulk e-mailing is done using `sendgrid` \n",
    "\n",
    "Sendgrid (from Twilio) is a service that allows you to send emails in bulk. It is a paid service, but it has a free tier that allows you to send up to 100 emails per day.\n",
    "You can use it to send emails to participants with their API keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can sign up for a free account at [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other services that allow you to send emails in bulk, such as [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) and [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/), but we will use SendGrid for this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "In old days this was done using `smtplib` and `email` libraries, however, these days most e-mail providers have limits on how many emails you can send per day, so it is better to use a service that is designed for this purpose.\n",
    "This notebook will show you how to use SendGrid to send emails to participants with their API keys"
