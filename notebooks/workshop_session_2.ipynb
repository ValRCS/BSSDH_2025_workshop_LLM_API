    "We could extract documents manually by downloading the appropriate zip file and extracting files by *hand* using file extracting capabilities built into your Operating System(Windows has built in extractor) or using external program such as 7-zip, WinRAR, etc. However, it is more replicable and convenient to use a script that will do this for us. We would supply a url or file name and the script would download the file, extract it to approparite location, and return a list of files that were extracted.\n",

    "### Additional considerations when extracting documents\n",
    "\n",
    "* Where will be extracted files be stored? - Ideally we would have a same relative structure when extracting files locally and on remote server such as Google Colab.\n",
    "* How will we handle file names? - Usually we would like to keep the original file names, but we might want to add some additional information such as source or date of extraction.\n",
    "* How will we handle errors? - We should consider what to do if the file cannot be downloaded or extracted. Should we skip it or raise an error?\n",

    "### Extracting Latvian Economic Review\n",

It goes beyond surface-level keyword extraction by attempting to detect the underlying themes, topics, or conceptual entities present in the text -- including those that might not be explicitly named but are implied or paraphrased.\n",
